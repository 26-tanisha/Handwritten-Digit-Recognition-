# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). 
This has been a topic of boundless research in the field of deep learning.
Digit recognition has many applications like number plate recognition, postal mail sorting, bank check processing, etc. 
We can use machine learning and deep learning algorithms like SVM, CNN, and MLP for handwritten digit recognition.
In this project the algorithm used in CNN - Convolutional Neural Networks

## DATASET:
Handwritten character recognition is an expansive research area that already contains detailed ways of implementation which include major learning datasets, popular algorithms, features scaling and feature extraction methods. 
In this project, we used the MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is the subset of the NIST dataset which is a combination of two of NISTâ€™s databases: Special Database 1 and Special Database 3. 
Special Database 1 consists of digits written by high school students.
Special Database 3 consists of digits written by employees of the United States Census Bureau.
MNIST contains a total of 70,000 handwritten digit images (60,000 - training set and 10,000 - test set) 
Image size: 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased. All these images have corresponding Y values which apprises what the digit is.

## Algorithms and Libraries used:
1. Convolutional Neural Networks
   - In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural networks most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.
   - CNNs use a mathematical operation called convolution in place of general matrix multiplication in at least one of their layers.
   - They are specifically designed to process pixel data and are used in image recognition and processing. 

2. OpenCV
   - OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
   - By using it, one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
   - When it is integrated with various libraries, such as NumPy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. 

3. Keras
   - Keras is an open-source high-level Neural Network library.
   - It consists of three backend engines Theano, TensorFlow and CNTK.
   - It was developed by one of the Google engineers, Francois Chollet.
   - It is made user-friendly, extensible, and modular for facilitating faster experimentation with deep neural networks.
   - It supports Convolutional Networks and Recurrent Networks individually and their combination.

4. Matplotlib
   - Matplotlib is easy to use and an amazing visualizing library in Python.
   - It is built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack and consists of several plots like line, bar, scatter, histogram, etc.

5. TensorFlow
   - TensorFlow is an open-source software library.
   - TensorFlow is basically a software library for numerical computation using data flow graphs where:
   - nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations.
   - edges in the graph represent the multidimensional data arrays (called tensors) communicated between them.
   - It consists of multiple datasets and APIs.
